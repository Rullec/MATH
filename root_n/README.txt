in complex analysis, we have known that:
for any anbitrary complex number a belongs to C, this number has n roots whose times is nth.
and then, we know if we paint these roots on the complex plane, it will construct a N-regular polygon.
I reallyt feel shocked, so i decide to design this demo to paint it, pain its' N-regular polygon in MATLAB R2015b.
